            Dear You,
            first time that i met you, i thought you're just looks beauty. But the more day i know you, i found the beauty inside of you.
            you are the kindest person, the most caring person that i ever met. you pay attention on every single detail. but that's not the reason i love you.
            everyone has flaws, so do i. i feel so insecure about my body but you take my insecurity away. i feel comfort whenever around you.
            that's the day when love began to bloom. i swear i didn't mean to fall in love, it happened and i dont know what to do and how to stop it.
        </p>
